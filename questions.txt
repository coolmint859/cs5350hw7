1. Why is possible that Update and Delete Widget Requests may fail, even when you were
   running just one Consumer?

    A: I'm not too sure. I want to imagine it has something to do with the containerization. Maybe having it need to
       work in an isolated environment with it's own kernel causes some update/delete requests to finish on aws's side
       before the program can remove them from the queue or s3 bucket.

2. How would this possible behavior impact the design of distributed applications that use
   queues?

    A: Probably would mean that the need for dead-letter queues become especially important. Or the developers would need
       to have some kind of mechanism to deal with out-of-date requests that come into the queue.
